Purpose
	Build model to predict optimal inventory of each products in Saudi Arabia.
	find impact of discount and relevant variable.
	

	
Overview
	the data set contains location information and sales information, which is minimum data required to build predict model. Will build plan, analyze data and build model then take action.

Descriptive analysis
Quantity Vs. City
- All pvalue of categorical variables, city have high and this indicate each coefficient is not statisticaly significant and fail to reject the hypothesis the quantity of each city is the same.
Quantity Vs. product
-All pvalue of categorical variables, product have high and this indicate each coefficient is not statisticaly significant and fail to reject the hypothesis the quantity of each product is the same.

Big customers
# there are three big customers
# a special promotion on the big three will and make a deal with them will boost the market share.


EDA
- Taget variables
	Quantity and Final Sales
- Correlation heatmap : no linear relationship among numerical variables.

Popular product by city

	Costa Rica_Quantity    591
	Name: Abha, dtype: int64

	Brazilian_Quantity    516
	Name: Buraidah, dtype: int64

	Colombia_Quantity    590
	Name: Dammam, dtype: int64

	Guatemala_Quantity    621
	Name: Hail, dtype: int64

	Costa Rica_Quantity    520
	Ethiopian_Quantity     515
	Guatemala_Quantity     565
	Name: Jeddah, dtype: int64

	Colombia_Quantity      502
	Costa Rica_Quantity    592
	Name: Medina, dtype: int64

	Costa Rica_Quantity    632
	Name: Riyadh, dtype: int64

Overall sales
	- Hail is the most sales quantity 
	- From Jun to Sep, which are summer months, quantity higher, however with 95 confidence level 	  there is no difference between summer months and other months.
		
Build model
1.Discount rate
Quantity of sales by discount
	Build binomial logistic regression model with quantity as independent variable and Used_discoun as dependent variable. used confusion matrix to check the model validity and the model does not work with AUC 0.46.

----------> add other variables as independent variables and perform test.

2. Improving the Predictive Model
Even with your current dataset, you can try these strategies:
a) Feature Engineering


Derive new features:
	Per Capita Sales: Normalize sales based on city populations.
	Discount Effectiveness: Create a feature for 	'Discount_amount/final sales' to quantify discount impact.
	Seasonal Trends: Extract features from dates, like 'day of the 	week' or 'Holiday indicator'
b) Handle Categorical Variables
	Encode your categorical variables effectively. Try target encoding, frequency encoding, or embedding techniques for more meaningful representations.

c) Test Different Models
	Use advanced models like:
		Gradient Boosting Regressors (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost, 	LightGBM): Great for handling complex data and interactions.
		Neural Networks (DNN): If you have a large dataset and 	suspect non-linear patterns.
		Time Series Models: If your sales depend on temporal 	trends, try ARIMA, SARIMAX, or LSTM models.

d) Hyperparameter Tuning
	Use tools like GridSearchCV or Optuna to find the best 	parameters for your model.
e) Data Augmentation
	Simulate scenarios by creating synthetic data (e.g., use SMOTE 	for imbalanced sales data across cities/products).
f) Regularization
	Simulate scenarios by creating synthetic data (e.g., use SMOTE 	for imbalanced sales data across cities/products).

2. predicting inventory
In order to predict inventory required, used city, month, and product. however, i could not build the model as lack of relationships between independent and dependent variables. 

Conclusion
	I have found meaningful results such as the top buyer, and no correlation among variables.
I conclude that we need more informations to build models to predict quantity of sales and discount impact on sales. additional information may include related to quantity 
a)  Sales and Inventory Data
 Sales and Inventory Data
Historical Inventory Levels: Add information on past inventory amounts and stock-outs to capture supply-demand dynamics.
Waste/Expiration Data: Include the number of products that spoiled or went unsold to refine inventory predictions.
Sales Time Data: Record timestamps more granularly (e.g., daily/hourly sales) to account for short-term trends.

b)  Market/Customer Data
Promotions/Events: Track promotional activities and local events, which could impact sales spikes.
Customer Feedback: Add review/rating data or customer preferences for specific products

c) Geographic/Location Data
Foot Traffic: If sales locations are physical stores, include data on customer foot traffic
Regional Patterns: Consider adding broader regional economic indicators, such as population or income
